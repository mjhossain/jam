This file contains model code which works

This following code can be modified for the js function to work as a loop code and echo different data

<?php
          $post_set = find_all_posts(); // finds all posts
          $post_count = mysqli_num_rows($post_set); //sets a counter for posts
          for($count=1; $count <= $post_count; $count++) { // starts the loop to print stuff
            echo "<option value=\"{$count}\""; // echos some value
            if ($post["position"] == $count) { // condition applied
              echo " selected";
            }
            echo ">{$count}</option>";
          }

        ?>




The below code is the working model for while loop and printing all database objects


<?php

$marker_set = find_all_markers();
 ?>

 var markersData = [

 <?php
 $marker_count = mysqli_num_rows($marker_set);
 while($marker = mysqli_fetch_assoc($marker_set)) {


           $lat = $marker['lat'];
           $lng = $marker['lng'];
 ?>



          {
        lat: <?php echo $lat; ?>,
        lng: <?php echo $lng; ?>, },



 <?php  } //ending while block ?>


// Below code is just to debug and error as there should not be an ',' after '}' in the last object
        {
          lat: 40.7446287,
           lng: -73.939071,
        }

// Above code is for debug

          ];




// Working model code ends here
