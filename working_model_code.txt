This file contains model code which works

This following code can be modified for the js function to work as a loop code and echo different data

<?php
          $post_set = find_all_posts(); // finds all posts
          $post_count = mysqli_num_rows($post_set); //sets a counter for posts
          for($count=1; $count <= $post_count; $count++) { // starts the loop to print stuff
            echo "<option value=\"{$count}\""; // echos some value
            if ($post["position"] == $count) { // condition applied
              echo " selected";
            }
            echo ">{$count}</option>";
          }

        ?>
